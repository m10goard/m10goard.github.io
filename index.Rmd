After playing sports for over eighteen years, it is only natural that I should want to work in sports as well. As a senior studying mathematics, concentrating and minoring in statistics, and earning a certificate in sports analytics, I am putting myself in a position to be a very effective analyst.

I graduated from Appalachian State University in May of 2022 with a B.S. in Mathematics, Statistics concentration, with a minor in statistics, and a Sports Analytics certificate. I have decided to pursue even higher education as I am now in school for a Master of Arts in Mathematics, College Teaching concentration with a Business Analytics graduate certificate. 

While I am interested in all sports, I am mostly interested in baseball as I have played since I was three years old, and continue to play in college as a member of the Appalachian State club baseball team. Additionally, I work as part of the data analytics team here at Appalachian State. Over the summer when I am not playing or working with the data analytics team, I have begun coaching the American Legion Post 53 Redwings in Greensboro, NC.

Because of my experience playing, analyzing, and coaching baseball, I can provide multiple perspectives to ask questions for research. I have learned that communication between players, coaches, and analysts is very different. As I have experience in all three areas, I am able to communicate my research to different audiences more effectively.
