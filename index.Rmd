After playing sports for over eighteen years, it is only natural that I should want to work in sports as well. As a senior studying mathematics, concentrating and minoring in statistics, and earning a certificate in sports analytics, I am putting myself in a position to be a very effective analyst.

I am scheduled to graduate with my undergraduate degree in May of 2022, and I plan to pursue a graduate degree in mathematics the following year.

While I am interested in all sports, I am mostly interested in baseball as I have played since I was three years old, and continue to play in college as a member of the club baseball team. Not only this, but I work as part of the data analytics team here at Appalachian State. I also recognize that my playing days are numbered, and I have begun coaching the American Legion Post 53 Red Wings located in Greensboro, NC. 

Because of my experience playing, analyzing, and coaching baseball, I can provide multiple perspectives to ask questions for research. These perspectives also provide the ability to verbalize my thoughts and research in different ways, allowing me to communicate with many demographics.
